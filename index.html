            <p>An American professional basketball team

              National Basketball Association (NBA)
              as a member of the league's Eastern
              Conference Southeast Division. After a tough beginning
            to the season, the Hawks recovered during the end of the
            season, as they were able to salvage their playoff hopes
          as the tenth seed in the conference. They won both of their
        play-in games and thus became the eighth seed in the conference.</p>

              National Basketball Association (NBA) as
              a member of the league's Eastern
              Conference Southeast Division. The Heat breezed through
            their schedule during the 2022 NBA season, as they were one of
          the top seeds throughout the entire season. At the end of the season,
        they rose to the first seed in the East due to injuries on other teams.</p>

            <p>Before the beginning of their matchup, there wass a sense
            of cautious optimism from Hawks fans. While their team had a rough season,
            the team had gotten hot when it mattered the most and were playing very well
            together as a team. Fans were confident that the Hawks could at least put up
            a fight against the seemingly unbeatble Miami team. However, as game 1 of the
            series began, it became clear that the Hawks would have to outplay more than just
            the Heat.</p>
            <p>The Miami Heat were mainly the first seed due to their stifiling defense, but
            in this series, it seems like their defense had crossed the threshold from impressive to
            dirty. The Hawks players were getting battered around the court like they were playing in the
           NFL, and the refs were doing nothing to prevent the many plays against the Hawks that could
            cause major injury. </p>

            <p>Though very few Hawks fans expected their favorite team
            to pull through against one of the clear favorites for the NBA
            Finals, the clear opinion of most of those same fans is that they
            would have at least liked the Hawks to have a fair chance. The main appeal
            to the NBA is the unpredictability of the matchups, but when one team
            is given more leeway to play rough, then it takes that aspect of the game out
            of considereation completely.</p>
